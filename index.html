        <div>I write things mostly for SAAS companies, including user documentation, procedure writing, and guides. I'm not afraid of going under the technical hood,<img

                        This sample is designed not to show off my design abilities, but to be an example of
                        process-oriented writing. This project came about as an extension of me (1) trying to learn
                        something new, for which there was no good resource online and (2) wanting to break what I
                        learned
                        down into a conversational and approachable article for myself and others. My favorite kind of
                        writing isn‚Äôt stuffy or academic, but inviting and disarming, especially when writing about
                        potentially intimidating concepts.

                        dynamic
                        menu that responds to where you have scrolled to in a different area of the site. It could still
                        use
                        some work, but it sharpened my JavaScript skills and made me excited about using CSS animations,
                        media queries, and
                        <pre id="codeText">::before</pre>, which led to some cool hover effects, especially useful for
                        tool-tip
